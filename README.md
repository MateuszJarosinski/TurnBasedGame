# TurnBasedGame

Here is the project I am currently working on. You can think of it as the current showcase of my code. It is an implementation of turn-based combat based on a map made of hexes. I was inspired by games such as Baldurs Gate 3 and Heroes of Might and Magic. 

What I plan to include in the project:
- hex map generation
- A* pathfinding
- turn-based animation system
- skills system
- decision-making AI

And probably a lot more...
